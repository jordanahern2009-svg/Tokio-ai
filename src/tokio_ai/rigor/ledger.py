"""Session-level bookkeeping so an agent conversation can't p-hack itself.

Every hypothesis test run in a session gets recorded here. Verdicts are
issued relative to everything tested so far in the SAME session -- the 5th
signal tested in one sitting needs a stronger raw p-value than the 1st to
count as significant, which is exactly the discipline a naive
"just check p<0.05 every time" agent would skip.
