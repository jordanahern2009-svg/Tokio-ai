"""Common technical-pattern testing: derive a simple feature from daily bars,
split days into two groups by comparing the feature to a threshold, and run
the split through the rigor engine's permutation test.

This exists because asking an LLM to manually bucket hundreds of raw price
bars inline (as tool_hypothesis alone requires) is unreliable and
token-expensive -- classic case for "let code do the arithmetic, let the
model decide what to ask for."
